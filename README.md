## About
This app was developer as part of the [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) themed [Rails Hackathon](https://railshackathon.com/). We used [Hotwire Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) on certain pages to negate the need for full page reloads, for example when turning a page or translating certain sentences from a non-English language into English. Click [here](https://team50.herokuapp.com/) to visit out demo. 

Please note, this app is currently only optimised for desktop use in the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) browser.
